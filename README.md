# Nostalgia Pixelator üéØ

### Project Description
A full-stack web application that combines the retro aesthetics of 8-bit graphics with the uncanny power of modern AI. It's a digital memory decay machine that pixelates your photos and then uses Gemini AI to hallucinate their restoration.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world of flawless, high-resolution digital photos, our memories have lost their charm. We've forgotten the beauty of corrupted files, the mystery of a pixelated face, and the nostalgia of a low-fidelity aesthetic. Our digital lives are too perfect.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Nostalgia Pixelator solves this nonexistent problem by intentionally degrading your high-quality images into glorious 8-bit, monochromatic masterpieces. Then, with a single click, it uses Google's Gemini AI to "restore" them, creating a completely new, often unsettling, but always fun, version of your memory. It's a journey into what our memories would look like if a machine tried to recreate them from scratch.
